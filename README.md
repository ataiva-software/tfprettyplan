</div>

## Features

- Parses Terraform plan JSON files
- Displays a summary of resources to be created, updated, or deleted

## Installation

### Install via Script (Recommended)

Run this one-liner to install the latest version for your OS and architecture:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ataiva-software/tfprettyplan/main/install.sh | bash
```

This script:

- Detects your OS and CPU
- Fetches the latest release from GitHub
- Installs tfprettyplan into /usr/local/bin

You can inspect the script [here](https://github.com/ataiva-software/tfprettyplan/blob/main/install.sh).

For Windows, download the ZIP file from the releases page and extract it to a location in your PATH.

### Using Go

If you have Go installed, you can install TFPrettyPlan directly:

```bash
go install github.com/ataiva-software/tfprettyplan/cmd/tfprettyplan@latest
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ataiva-software/tfprettyplan.git
cd tfprettyplan
go build -o tfprettyplan ./cmd/tfprettyplan
```

## Usage

TFPrettyPlan can read Terraform plan files in JSON format. You can provide the plan file as an argument or pipe the JSON data to the tool.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Read from a file
tfprettyplan plan.json

# Using the -file flag
tfprettyplan -file plan.json

# Pipe from terraform show
terraform show -json plan.tfplan | tfprettyplan
```

### Formatting Options

```bash
# Use wider output format for better readability
tfprettyplan -wide plan.json

# Set a specific terminal width
tfprettyplan -width 120 plan.json

# Disable automatic width detection
tfprettyplan -no-auto-width plan.json

# Combine options as needed
tfprettyplan -wide -no-color plan.json
```

### Flags

- `-file, -f`: Path to Terraform plan JSON file
- `-no-color`: Disable color output
- `-version, -v`: Show version information
- `-wide`, `-w`: Use wider output format for better readability of long values
- `-width`: Set a fixed terminal width (overrides auto-detection)
- `-no-auto-width`: Disable automatic terminal width detection

## Example

To use TFPrettyPlan with a Terraform plan:

1. Generate a Terraform plan file:

   ```bash
   terraform plan -out=plan.tfplan
   ```

2. Convert the plan to JSON:

   ```bash
   terraform show -json plan.tfplan > plan.json
   ```

3. Use TFPrettyPlan to visualize the plan:

   ```bash
   tfprettyplan plan.json
   ```

   Or in a single command:

   ```bash
   terraform show -json plan.tfplan | tfprettyplan
   ```

## Table Formatting Examples

### Standard Format (Default)

```
• aws_s3_bucket.logs (aws_s3_bucket)
  +---------------+------------------+------------------+
  |   ATTRIBUTE   |    OLD VALUE     |    NEW VALUE     |
  +---------------+------------------+------------------+
  | acl           | private          | public-read      |
  | force_destroy | false            | true             |
  | tags.Name     | Log Bucket       | Logs Bucket      |

  | tags.Name     | Log Bucket with a longer name  | Logs Bucket with details       |
  | description   | This is a short description... | This is a longer description...|
  +---------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
```

### Smart Truncation

For long values, TFPrettyPlan uses smart truncation to preserve important parts:

- **Path-like strings**: Preserves beginning and end parts
  ```
  /very/long/path/with/many/nested/directories/file.txt → /very/long/.../file.txt
  ```

- **JSON-like values**: Preserves structure
  ```
  {"key":"value","nested":{"prop":"too long to display fully"}} → {"key":"value","nested":{"prop":"too...}}
  ```

- **Long strings**: Truncates middle
  ```
  This is a very long string that exceeds the column width → This is a...column width
  ```

## Releases and Versioning

TFPrettyPlan uses semantic versioning and automated releases:

- New releases are automatically created when code is pushed to the main branch
- Releases follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Each release includes pre-built binaries for all supported platforms
- Release notes are automatically generated from commit messages

You can find all releases on the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ataiva-software/tfprettyplan/releases).

## Testing

TFPrettyPlan includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure the reliability and correctness of its functionality.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use the standard Go testing tools:

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...
